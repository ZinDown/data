Subject: Request for Assistance in Receiving Emails Regarding Google Play Console

Dear Google Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding an issue with receiving emails related to my Google Play Console account. Unfortunately, I noticed that my Gmail account is rejecting or not receiving emails from your platform, including important messages about my Play Console activities.

This has caused significant inconvenience, and I am unable to proceed with certain tasks due to the lack of communication. I kindly request your assistance in resolving this matter so that I can continue using Play Console without disruptions.

If possible, please resend any recent communications or guide me on resolving email deliverability issues. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
